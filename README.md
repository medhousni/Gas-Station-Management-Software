# Project Description
This is a software I developed during my time working as an IT Coordinator for Total Energies. I witnessed that many tasks done by the gas stations managers where repetitives
and sometime needed to be done by a less qualified staff that was not as experienced in MS Excel and needed constant guidance, so I developped an all in one software 
to simplify the data entry which could be stored in a database and as an excel file.
